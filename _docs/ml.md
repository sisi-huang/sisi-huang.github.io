- CNN(Convolutional neural network): 

A CNN is a special kind of neural network, which has been successfully applied for image classification, video recognition, recommendation system, etc. The CNN is also considered as an improved version of a multilayered network, whose elements are similar to the feedforward neural network: input layer, output layer and multiple hidden layers.

- Transfer Learning: 

Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique that pays attention to store the acquired knowledge from the solution of a problem, and then apply the common part of this knowledge to solve another problem. Humans are good at transferring the knowledge that they have already acquired, to a new field. For example, a badminton player has an advantage of learning how to play tennis: even though badminton rules are different from tennis rules, they are similar to each other. With the help of ”transfer learning”, this player is able to apply the common sense of the knowledge in playing badminton to play tennis.
