[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package for building interactive web applications, it's a good approach for dynamic data visualization, especially applying 
for daily updated data. As a big fan of shiny, developing my own shiny is not a big ideal right now. However, there are lots of tricks that must be known for shiny developers like me.

Here I list some shiny apps, some of them are developed by myself, some are cooperated with our team. (Code review on [Github](https://github.com/sisi-huang).)

- [Asian restaurants in Berlin](https://sisihuang.shinyapps.io/interactivemap/)
- [DDWizard](https://eos.wzb.eu/ipi/DDWizard/)
- [CausalQueries Demo](https://eos.wzb.eu/ipi/CausalQueries/)
- Covid-19 Shiny (will be released soon!)
